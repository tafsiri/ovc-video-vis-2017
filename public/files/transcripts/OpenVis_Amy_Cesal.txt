>> All right.  We're going to go ahead and get started.  We're just a few minutes late.  We'll catch up, I'm sure.  How was taco lunch?  Pretty good, yeah.  I think in the game of sandwich versus taco, we have a clear winner.  Cool, I'm excited to start our next batch of talks.  And love to welcome Amy to the floor.  A graphic designer in data visualization who works from the federal government.  Before that, the sunlight foundation focused on government transparency.  She created the first data visualization style guide and is instrumental to continuing that work.  So please give her a warm welcome.

>> Okay.  I feel like I've accomplished something already.  Thanks for quick Googling and two other humans to help me.
So, I'm, I'm Amy Cesal.  I'm going to talk about why data visualization needs a style guide.  This is where you can find me on the Internet with my Twitter handle.
Basically, I'm a graphic designer.  I've worked at the sunlight foundation and at the consumer financial protection bureau where I currently work and helped create data visualizations for each of them.  I will talk through the creative for both of them.  What is a style guide?  These terms can be used interchangeable, I know some of you know what a style guiled is, but for those who don't, I'm going give background.  Style guides educate people working with the brand on what to do or not to do.  To keep things consistent.  If things are not consistent, they are trustworthy.  And they're committed to standards and helps build and maintain your organization's reputation.  Twitter's logo guidelines, whatnot to do with the iconic Twitter bird.  Like not to personify it by adding a hat and a bow tie.  But allows them to enforce consistent use of the logo and through staff changes and through brand integrity.  And type face weight and size to use.  This ensures cohesion between different parts of the organization so that Web pages match mobile apps, match brochures and reports.  So your brand is instantly recognizable between uniforms and medium.  And allows the brand to be extended into different brands quickly and with uniformity.  MailChimp takes guidelines a step further with a content style guide with grammar choices, like use a colon rather than ellipse.  And seems they were created by the same person.  They even have a voice and tone microsite, providing�specific examples of how and when to use language which takes into consideration what the user might be feeling.  This ensures a consistent experience, and MailChimp is meeting their needs at every step.  Even the United States digital service, USDS, created guidelines for applications and how thing about guidelines for the American people.  Not only guiding for how users should approach building things, but also templates and UI components that are tested for accessibility.  This ensures they aren't solving the same simple problems like what a button looks like again and again and frees them up to solve more complex issues.  These guidelines can seem strict, but I think they work better for data visualization when you think of your brand as a family.  You know, kind of like the Baldwin brothers.  They have similar visual traits, and you can tell they're clearly relate the, but they have their own unique personality with quirks.  Like perfect hair or a quirky sense of humor.  I think FiveThirtyEight does a particularly good job of creating a family of charts.  Looking into their year in review of the 52 best and weirdest charts, I was blown away.  They are similar to showcase the data.  You can't tell what programs they were created in, and don't look like the software or technology that was used to make them, but rather like the brand.  It is an attention to detail that implies that similar care was taken with the data, while each visual allows a particular point of data to be clear.
Looking at the titles of some of these graphs, they have a uniform short and catchy title and a longer, but descriptive subtitle.  The tone is similar as well as the color, spacing, and typography.  And the footer has fairly consistent content, which includes the brand logo and the data source.  It adds transparency and integrity to the graphics.  And having these included in a style guide makes it part of the routine production process.  It ensures that information isn't left out.  And all these charts have similar colors.  The pie chart shows the usage of the colors over all of the charts.  They have a light gray background and generally muted tones with more saturated colors for emphasis.  However, there's a large variety of colors that all work well together to create a uniqueness and personality within the family of visualizations.  However, your graphs shouldn't look exactly the same, like identical twins.
This is an old graphic from the Washington Post.  And all of these pie charts are basically the same visually except for the numbers.  You can't tell which charts are related, and it's easy to gloss over all of them.  It doesn't highlight the unique and interesting aspects of the data.  It all kind of feels the same.  So why does data visualization in particular need a unique style guide?  It would be much easier to have just one template and not a whole guide.  However, there are so many data visualization programs out there.  They each have pros and cons and people have different skillsets of what they're comfortable with.  Having just one template for one program limits the organization to just using that software.  It would make it harder to adapt to whatever new, crazy, cool technology like beta.plot/chart/js that comes up in the future.  You want to make something that can with stand the test of time or at least last until the next version.
If you have guidelines, no matter where the programs are created, they will flow harmoniously.  If even not all of the software can 100% do the guidelines, it will help your graphics have more cohesion.
So, again, why should you have a guide?  You want to design for organizations, not software.  You want to build templates for common programs that all work towards a common standard that's not dictated by just one program.  Make contrast and accessibility easy.  If you bake in good standards for accessibility, then all the graphs are more readable by default.  Having a data visualization style guide improves ease and speed.  It makes it easier to make graphs when you don't have it redesign the world.  Allows staff to have some flexibility and eliminate bottlenecks.  Attention to detail.  When they are similarly designed, it implies attention to detail taken with the data.  And you want to know the rules before you break them.  Having some education in the guide so people know why they're doing things, and they're deviating from the guide, they do it with intentionality.  So what in particular should be in a good data visualization style guide?
Color, text, tone, and layout.  So look at how the brand guidelines specifically apply to data visualization.  Someone creating a chart doesn't want to dig through the standards and take their best guess to if the headline should be an H3 or an H4.  You want to set a consistent tone and expectations across all of why�graphics.  You want to include chart examples.  Knowing what things have been done in the past can inform people if they want to do similar or different things in the future.
You want to know who is reading your graphs.  Your target consumers.  Figure out the base knowledge and needs of your consumers, you can make graphs that work for them.  You want to know who is making your graphs, your chart creators.  And you want to write a guide for who will be using it and give them the knowledge they'll need to create charts.  And you want to find what works and what doesn't before standardizing it.  You want to make sure that you have a solid foundation and a tested style before you go to write standards.  So what does putting together a good family of charts look like?
This first example is about making a data visualization style guide at the sunlight foundation.  I worked there in 2013 and it's a nonpartisan nonprofit that focus on open data and government transparency.  And at that time there was a staff of about 45 people.  I knew everyone's name and it was easy to pop by someone's desk and ask them a question or to explain something.
The tone of things� sorry� the tone of things being created was designheavy.  We had several designers at the organization and had a unique visual style.  The charts were also dataheavy.  We had a lot of open data and some of it was really complicated.  And we were also doing sophisticated analysis that sometimes required complex visuals.
But the data visualizations we were producing were not consistent with that tone.  It was either default ggplot style charts made in R with a logo slapped on them and these weren't serving the organization niece needs.  They weren't getting picked up and republished by journalists, a big goal for us.  And the logo was cropped out and we lost ownership and attribution over them.
Or we were creating overlydesigned infographic style visuals.  There was a lot of design work with them.  They were popular on Pinterest, but not republishable for the inside the beltway audience we were hoping to reach.  And they were more number decoration than the depth of the analysis.  They didn't look like they were related.  They didn't look like part of the same family.  So we made some adjustments and found a style that both sides could be happy with.  We looked at the target consumers of the data visualization, mainly journalists and researchers.
And we took into account the needs of the people who were creating the charts.  Researchers who wanted to get things out fairly quickly and be news worthy, but also do indepth analysis.  Graphic designers who wanted the flexibility to create something unique when a project required it.  Developers who had a lot of data and wants to show it an interactive, explore tour way, but be on brand.  Young journalists who may not have worked with data before, but needed a simple chart to support the story.  What did the data visualization style guide include?  Started by setting the tone.  It explained this was a guide that was a starting point and you should do what makes sense for the data.  And to respect the data as you explore the wonderful, but often confusing world, of turning numbers into visuals.
The guide pulled out specific type styles and how they should be used for data visualization.
It included hex, RGB, and brand values for colors.  Each included a tint and a shade for groups or stacked bar charts which came in handy for easily adding emphasis.  And there was a place for no data or null values rather than ignoring that.  And it went further, what kind of content?  A lot of the content was with politics.  It made sense to have a separate set of color for the republican, democrat and independent parties that worked well and could be separated from the work that focused on nonpolitical things.  We had visuals that showed pro, con, or positive and negative data.  So having like a reddish color and a greenish color that worked well together, but were still accessible to people with color blindness was important.  About one in 12 men of European decent are red/green color blind.  So it was important to build this into our choices.
The greenish choice had blue in it, so it was able to be separate from the red color.  We didn't have to test for color blindness every time we made a new chart.  We knew the colors worked together.
We spec�d out the basic structure of a graph in a size that would fit nicely, and in depth details.  Like the weight and color of the access lines and how far from the margins the logo should sit.  The developers loved this.  They built templates for R�and D3 and didn't have to bug the designers for the details.
And what the chart looks like.  It described in bullet points when it should or should not be used, and it showed a small table of what the data should look like� what the data should look like to create that chart.  Which was useful for designers and journalists who might not have had as much data background.  And showed how to label your axis and the data source.  These are important to remember to maintain the credibility and data integrity.
So after socializing the guide within the organization and doing a couple of presentations about what it was and how to use it, this is what our charts looked like.  We put a lot of effort into getting everyone enthusiastic about using it.  And explained how much easier and better it would make their work.  Overall the charts are more harmonious.  They look like a family.  Each with different quirks, but similar genetic makeup.  Since there's a solid foundation in place when creating a chart, people could consistently break the rules in one or two ways, and the chart would look like the same family.  It allowed sunlight to make simple graphs more quickly and just more of them.  And allowed real effort to be put into making complex visuals when needed.  And from the guide came templates.  Created a ggplot for R which helped the researchers get graphics out more quickly.  The graphics were about 80% towards the real template, so less cleanup for the designers.  And it allowed the visuals that really showed the uniqueness of the data.
And one of the other developers, Bob, made a D3.JS template.  It allowed other developers to throw data into it and added branding color scheme and the branding color wrapper.  So allowing people to use the tools of their choice that they were comfortable with made it really easy for them to produce publishable work.
And it was easy for the designers to have a template in illustrator.  And they could expand to do custom things that required more design work.  And it was easy to pull the essence of the style guide into other programs that might be more of a one-off need.  Like creating network graphs in Gephi.  It wasn't a big deal to try new software for only a couple of projects.  And after all the designers were no longer with the organization, the communication staff still use the essence of the style guide for graphics.  Which I think makes it successful.
I was hired by the consumer financial protection bureau, which is going to be the second example of making a data visualization style guide.  The CFPB is a U.S. government agency that makes sure banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat consumers fairly.  There's about 1500 staff, which is a far cry from the 45 at a nonprofit.
The tone of the design is a focus on plain language and centers on being userfriendly.  It's a very clean and straightforward brand esthetic.  It's a design goal to give the data a voice and make numbers digestible and clear.  We started to have honest, transparent design that wins the public's trust.  Data visualization was not a part of their design manual when I started, but they wanted it to be.
So we kicked off the project with a brainstorm and looked at the data visualization that had been created over the past three or four years.  It was a lot of Tableau and Excel charts, some graphics and illustrator in D3, but it was very data heavy.  We looked at style guidelines from the different organizations like the UK government and the data visualization checklist.  We voted on what types of content to include and what would be useful to the users of our guide.
There was a wide variety of people who create graphics at CFPB.  And because of the size of the organization, it's impossible to have close relationships with every one of them.  So the guide needs to be more verbose and do a lot more education and explain the "Why" behind things.  We set up a series of one on one consultation meetings to help people talk through their data visualization needs.
The largest target for our visuals are the American public.  Which is a big target.  It's everyone.  And we can't exclude people.  But another target for some of our projects is a focus on experts.  Basically, people who have a higher level of familiarity with the subject so we can produce more complex visuals for them.  Here the data visualization style guidelines are part of the larger design for the organization.  However, it's a separate section for people who might not need the design or Web components.  It starts by setting the tone of when and why this guide should be used.  There are key questions in each section which are a good overview for people to look at.  And it's public on the Internet and on GitHub like our other design manual content.
It shows what colors to use and what to use them for, and the emphasis for null and it's tested for color blindness.  It gives a quick overview of the pieces of a graph which combine style notes with content.  It shows how to display important context like sources or dates that help maintain our credibility as graphics get shared.
And there's an emphasis on accessibility.  As a government agency, we need to be 508 compliant.  That's Section 508 amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for those of you who didn't know.  Which boils down to, requires federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.  So how do we do that for data visualization?
Well, it starts with having descriptive titles on charts to help the user understand the chart and give them context for what they're seeing.  We try to not just rely on color for meaning, but to have direct labels or patterns in order to help people identify different things.
There's a minimum standard for color contrast and type size, and so our goal is to follow the W3's Web content accessibility guidelines, WC AG for short.  These standards are included in the basics of the guide.  It's not just in the accessibility section, so it's not an afterthought.
And we try to write good alt tags for when our charts are just images.  The goal is to include the chatter type for users who might be partially sighted and using a screen reader to supplement their experience.  As well as a short description of the point of the graph and to include a CSV or other readable data sheet.  So users who can't see can tab through and at least get a sense of things that are in the chart.
But also, having a CSV adds transparency.  So you can see exactly what data is in our graphs.  So even if your organization isn't required to think about accessibility, I think it helps the experience for all users to do at least these basic things.
Just a quick review.  In both the data visualization style guide examples, they included color, text, tone, and layout, which helps the charts be consistent and provide context.  Having chart examples helped users know what they should aim for.  Knowing who is reading your graphs, your target consumers, and you want to make sure your audience's needs were met.
Knowing who is making your graphs allows the guides to provide tailored content for what would be most useful.  And figuring out what works and what doesn't before standardizing it made sure that there was a solid foundation to build on.
And they were designed for organizations, not software.  So that people in the organizations could use whatever visualizing tool that they were comfortable with.  They made contrast in accessibility easy.  Good standards for accessibility easy� good standards for accessibility made all the graphs more readable.  Having a data visualization style guide improves speed and ease because it cut out solving simple problems multiple times.
Having an attention to detail ensured that things like sources or logos were not left out.  And knowing the rules before we broke them� just having rules in general� allowed people to break them with intentionality.
So take your data visualization to a more refined level.  A data visualization style guide is not just for branding, but for accessibility, consistency, and ease.  It's really an investment in your organization's credibility.  Thank you.
