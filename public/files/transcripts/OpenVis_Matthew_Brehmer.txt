>> Thanks, Irene.  So throughout history people have been recording sequences of events so that they can reconstruct and tell stories about the past.  Now, today I'm going to talk about visual representations of these sequences of events.  About timelines and the different stories that we can tell with them.  So I'm going to show you a lot of design choices and examples today, but I also promise to give a structured way to think about that design space.  And finally introduce a new tool that my colleagues and I at Microsoft research have developed to tell expressive stories with this type of data.
In order to talk about timelines, first start by thinking about time itself.  And specifically how people use spatial metaphors when thinking about time.  And because I'm speaking to a room of visualization people, I think we're all pretty good at mapping the dimension of time to coordinates on a page or a screen.  So let me put some questions to you.  I would like you to take a moment and ask yourself the questions that you see appearing here.  The question is, where are these moments in space occurring relative to you at this moment right now?  Not when.  So if you were to draw this, where would you put the future?  Where would you put the past?  And does your visual metaphor for time change on the fans and the scale of the event.  I put these to you, the ability to visualize time and space is an ability that people have learn and refine over time.  It differs from person to person and as we age and across cultures and across application contexts.
So how many of you thought of a straight line as the line of time?  Probably most people, right?
There's an arrow from the past to the future.  But which direction did your arrow point?  So depending on your cultural background and first language, as it's written, maybe to the left.  Maybe it points downwards.  Maybe you're on Twitter right now and your arrow is pointing to the most recent Tweet.  How many of you thought of a different visual representation for time when any of those events, those questions I had on the screen?  A few people, maybe.
So even if you didn't, I'm going to talk about some alternative representations for time today and hopefully give a sense of when to use these different representations.  And I'll begin with this most familiar.  This time as an arrow metaphor.  So this representation for time, it's dominated the design of timelines for several centuries.  First made popular by Joseph Priestly.  The dimension of time running from left to right.  And he's drown the life spans of notable figures and offset them vertically to avoid overdrawing.  Otherwise, no real meaning to the Y axis.  It's a faceting between statesmen and politicians at the bottom and men of learning or philosophers at the top
  So this representation, this type of design is popular today.  This is much more recent.  This is a timeline of Guantanamo detainees by Jonathan Corum for the New York Times.  It's the same idea.  Each horizontal line is the time that an individual was detained between 2003 and 2011.  It's a large graphic.  It works for a bird's eye or omniscient view of time.  But another model for time is ego centric.  It puts you along the line of time.  And that arrow is taking a trip down a museum hallway and examining the contents over time.  Walking into the past or the future.
And we can see this ego centric view of time like this one.  This is depicting the history of the tower of London.  It's like a moving sidewalk on the airport and time actually flying past you.  Now, another really common way that we represent time, it's the circle.  And especially when we're representing natural cycles, events that repeat.  Biological life cycles, seasons of the year.  Some of our daily routines, like when we sleep, eat, relax.  When Beyonc� performs.  But what if your data doesn't contain cycles or periodic repetition, is it still okay to use a circular or a radial representation for this type of data?  So in this example, this is Georgia Lepew's circular representation of her history.  Her birth is 12:00, her current age is around 11:00.  And at that point, the timeline veers upwards and trails off into uncertainty with dotted lines, not towards her birth.  It has a discontinuity, but uses a radial representation.
Another example.  This depicts the Arab Spring beginning in late 2010 and the different events in different countries.  This was on a site a few years ago.  A lot of email liked it.  Some ways to improve it.  The discontinuity between the end and the beginning.  It spans 134 months and not the annual span of 12.  So this prompted Alberto Cairo to design this as a linear timeline.  It's better for looking at the beginning and endings of events across countries.  Many might argue, and many did when he published, it's not aesthetically as pleasing as the original.
Here I have taken the data, and draw the viewer in with an attractive representation.  It shows the discontinuity of the start and the end in the top left.  And then transition to a linear representation to allow the viewer to make more accurate comparisons across these countries.  Or facet them into radial small multiples, and maintains the same amount of screen space devoted to these individual countries.
Perhaps you're more inclined to see time as linear and radial.  As a coil or a spring or something that repeats, but yet it spirals upwards or forwards like this spiral staircase.  And this spiral metaphor, it's particularly effective when we're depicting processes like growth, like a vine wrapping around a column.  So this example is a bunch of spiraling timelines that Moebio Labs created for the Ross Institute and looks at A12 education.  Spirals to me, at least to me, evoke the slinky toy.  It adds a new element to how we manipulate time.  The ability to compress and expand into larger shapes.
So if that's too complicated, we could think of the linear analog to that, that's the accordion of time.  This is already a metaphor when we are laying out collapsible interfaces.  Can we do the same thing for time?  Similarly imagine collapsing representations of time.  And to do this, I'll use this example from several centuries ago.  There is Mercator, map projection fame.  This is from the late 16th century.  It was to indicate a more precise passing of time in the margins next to written descriptions of events.  Fewer tick marks for sparse periods of history with nothing recorded.  And more tick marks when it was known of an event.  And collapse the sparse periods of history with an interaction or animation, but retain some indication that an event has occurred, time has elapsed.  I'm going to illustrate by drawing a timeline of 50 years of category five hurricanes from 1960 to 2010.  Donna in the '60s to the end.  And I can show the time elapsed between the hurricanes using bars.  And shows something different than before.  It indicates some fluctuation in the appearance between these hurricanes and that they have been getting shorter in the past couple of decades in this data set.
Now, another approach to collapsing time is just to use a different representation for different granularities of time.  So this is a timeline that Catholic missionaries were using in the mid-19th century to teach Native Americans about the history of Christianity.  And they were using the years as dots, and centuries as horizontal lines to show different granularities of time.  Understandably, they had to show a lot of data here.  This was a very large graphic, a tapestry.  And this is to abridge the time between biblical creation and Christ and the founding of Christianity and the founding of the 19th century.
So calendars also encode granularities using different representations, using a nested structure days as cells, rows as weeks, and months as polygon shapes.  And like radial representations, calendars are good at showing patterns and deviations, particularly when they agree with culturallyagreed upon days end, weekends and quarters.
So calendars are like a book shelf.  A shelf with seven books.  But it works well for larger granularities of time.  Decades or centuries or millennia.  And this is an instantiation, this is from the mid-19th century.  This was a teaching aid to learn about history.  She was using this ten by ten grid depicting each century.  Each cell was colored in depend on what category of event occurred in that year.  If you're interested in this example, check out revival� an interactive revival of this teaching method at the digital lab at Georgia tech.  Shape of history.net.
The last representation is much less restrained by any familiar shape.  What you're seeing are playful, curved timelines drawn by Mark Twain over a century ago and published an article in Harper's Magazine about using these shapes to remember dates.
I was wondering maybe if I use this approach, I can finally remember the succession of Canadian prime ministers, which, as a Canadian, is something I should know.  If they resemble a shape that kind of looks like a maple leaf.  Maybe.  So I took you on a brief, but certainly incomplete tour of different spatial metaphors for time.  And along the way showed you several examples of timelines.
But I'm going to move on to talk about other aspects of this timeline design space.  You need to consider what that timeline is for, and how different combinations of visual representation and visual metaphor and different time scales tell different stories.
So what is a timeline for?  So one way to go about answering this question is just to try to distinguish it with other types of charts that answer different questions involving timeoriented data.  So I would say, my simple answer to what's a timeline for, is it communicates what happened, when.  But meanwhile, if you have other chart types, line or area charts or scatterplots, they tell you how much over time.  Trajectory map or a flow map will tell you aspects of where, what, and when.  You have dynamic graphs family trees, the storyline charts made popular a few years ago, and how entities are related over time.  And this question of what if?  That's flowcharts and branching.  So, of course, there's a lot of instances out there where you'll be combining a timeline with some other chart type.  Or developing a custom chart type that develops these questions in a unique way.  I think of Napoleon's march map as one example of that.
But look at the deceptively simple question of what happened when.  We come to more questions?  In what sequence did these entitles occur?  For lounge?  And if you take any two events, event A, B, did they cooccur?  What was the nature of the overlap?  When did they occur to a common baseline event, like event C here?  So as an example to take apart some of these questions, let's look at these from Accurat a few years ago.  These are notable 20in' century painters.  Their life span, artistic periods, where they traveled, romantic conquests, all that.  And shown along a common chronological time line.  So here I'm going to redraw part of this timeline, remix it.  Here I have Salvador Dali's, based on the graphic.  You can see his artistic periods in brown.  Surrealism and Dada and travel to places like Paris.  And now Matisse alongside him.  I'm using a common chronological scale.  Shift over Dali, and you can see the respective cubist and abstract periods and perhaps when they might have influenced one another.  But change the scale to one that's relative to birthdays, when they started art, how long they lived.  And similarities.  They both traveled to Paris when they were in their 30s.  And finally, I can facility they are data and remove everything else.  I can remove all the chronological duration of all of these events, and focus on one event.  The artistic periods.  And retaining the sequential order of all they went through.  And allows me to compare the variety of styles in their careers.
So ultimately each of these transformations that this went through, resulted in a very difficult visual timeline and tells a different story each time.  So there's� just to recap now� there's several design choices in telling stories at the timelines.  The scales, absolute chronological scale, log time scale, sequential scales.  The third consideration, layout.  How you lay them out on a page or a screen.  And facet between multiple timelines like with Dali and Matisse, or wrap into meaningful segments like century or decade.  And ifs any you're worried about the common space of these design choices, don't worry.  My colleagues and I have written a journal paper about this timeline design space.  It was based on a survey of over 250 timelines and timeline tools.  And we have over 20 design choices that correspond to feasible, perceptual tasks, what would you want to communicate with a timeline?  And comment on esthetic tradeoffs and the aspect given the data sets.  Forgive the dense figure, but you can browse the survey and the galleries at timelinesrevisitted.github.io.  Now that we're equipped with design choices, arriving at the question of how do you tell stories with the different points in the timeline design space?  How can you define different interactive elements?  Animation in annotation?  Tell these stories incrementally to tell parts of a narrative piece by piece.  Make different types of comparisons.  And you have seen this in my little example of comparing Dali to Matisse.  And you can make a choose your own adventure timeline.  Quite a few tools lieu you to do this.  This is an example, Timeglider.  These are openended, explore tour.  They don't guarantee if you have a story, they aren't necessarily communicated to the viewer.  They're fine for an openended bit of exploration by clicking on the events and finding out what they're about.  And a lot of data analysis tools do this, especially in the domain of electronic health records where you're doing an openended analysis task.  But if you have a narrative, these choose your own adventure tools don't guide the narrative.
At the other end of the story telling spectrum there is a tool, a style, about revealing a timeline as a slide show one at a time in a left to right chronological order in which the events occurred.  This is by this tool, Timeline JS by the northern lab.  There must be middle ground between the exploration and one event at a time.  There must be more flexible options out there.  And if we consider how stories unfold in written language, they don't always stick to a strict order of events.  I could have walked through Dali's life one event at a time.  But I focused on artistic periods and then Matisse.  And then chronological similarities in the past.  So it wasn't strict.  And this can be seen as I� there was an open source tool developed by Fulda.  We are both members at the British of Columbia.  This is after you load in text, it uses natural language to extract references to an event.  This is the history of pop music in Iceland.  And in this interface, it becomes possible to simultaneously highlight within the text an event that course, as well as with the chronological timeline you see above.  Here it becomes possible that the event in which it appears in the written story can differ from the timeline.  And this characteristic is not unique to the story about pop music from Iceland.  It's true of all stories.  They don't always unfold with the earliest event at the start.
So if we are to tell compelling stories with timelines, our tools need to be more flexible and impressive.  For some stories, a chronological, this happened and that happened� certainly makes sense.  For other types of stories.  For example, comparing the life of Dali to Matisse, might not make as much sense.  And similarly, bring in from the beginning of the talk, the ways that we represent time, scale time, shouldn't be stuck with linear representations and chronological.
And this goal of storytelling, it's why we built a tool, Timeline Storyteller.  This is an open source tool that we released a few months ago.  And I have used this tool in the talk to show examples.  It's a scenebased presentation tool.  Runs in the Web browser.  The author, reveal, annotate, and choose a better time scale to represent the event.
So look at how it works.  When I open up Timeline Storyteller, add in Google sheet data, et cetera.  And I will recreate the Dali Matisse story from earlier.  Each is an event.  I am fascinated by painters.  I have the painters, start date and end date.  Some of the dates are optional.  And text annotations.
When I load the data, I first get a summary of what's in the data, chronological range, different facets.  And when it's drawn, a single linear timeline.  It's not faceted by painter, so I choose a faceted layout.  Next I want to filter just to show Dali and Matisse.  Don't want the other painters.  So I use this filtering layer to hide the one I don't want.  And click on the events to annotate them.  And position the annotations wherever I want.  And when I'm satisfied, I can record this scene that I'm building as a scene that appears down in my little scene train down here and that's retained for the first scene in my story.  Next, I can then change the scale, as I did before, to one that's relative to the beginning of the first event and their facets.  This is according to their birth.  And repeat the process again, compare Dali and Matisse according to their birth.  Annotate again, and record this as yet another scene in my story that gets added on.
And then I can change the representation using this interface too.  I can annotate� I can change it for a radial representation.  And I can also bring in other forms of annotation.  I have used text annotation, I can put Dali into respect to his timeline, same with Matisse.  And then when I'm satisfied with my new scene, the scene in the story, but I can export as PNG, SVG, sport as an mated GIF.  Or toggle in the presentation mode with a live demonstration like here.
And now a complete story with storytelling.  It's a remix of projects from a few years ago.  Motivated by two timeline graphics.  And inspired by Mason Curry's how artists work.  And it's minimal timelines depicting 24 hours in the day of a famous creative person.  And in the mouse, what particular activities someone was performing at that time of day.  And on the right, a much more heavily annotated static radial timelines by R.J. Andrews of info we trust.  It's better for cooccurring activities, synchronicities throughout the day.  What they were doing.  And Andrew's on the right is better for individual stories and emphasizing this notion of a repeating routine.  Something that happens over and over again.  What I want to do now is tell a story that combines aspects of both of these existing examples, and highlight some additional interesting aspects of this data.
So let's begin by considering the daily routine of French writer Victor Hugo.  And his routine� he devoted a lot of time in the morning and the evening to periods of creative work in his day.  So he would write several hours in the morning, resume again in the evening.  But the rest of his day filled with a number of other eccentric activities like bathing on the roof of his building, visiting the barber and the mistress, strenuous exercise.  Are all creative people this eccentric and different?  So I bring in Franz Kafka here.  Very different from Hugo.  Struggled to sleep at night.  A day job at an insurance company and caught up on sleep late in the afternoon.  Is it that all creative people in the data set and the book it was based on have an individual and different routine?  To do that, bring in more people in the data set.
So I have 25 people in this example now.  But looking at all at once and scrolling like this could be a bit overwhelming.  Where are the patterns, if there are any?  So we need to direct our attention a little bit.  So I'll direct the attention just to the periods of creative work during the day.  We have people who work in short bursts like Immanuel Kant and Charles Darwin.  And others in long durations.
And another comparison.  Direct your attention to types of sleep patterns.  Is there a relationship between sleep and creative working?  We have some people that are nappers.  But most tend to sleep at night.  We have some unusual exceptions, Kafka, Balzac at 6:00 at night, and Voltaire only for three hours.
It's not a chronological representation, but variety in a routine.  To answer the question, how varied are the routines?  Remove the aspect of chronological duration and retain the sequence of events in the data.  That allows us to see how many unique activities appeared in a day.  And using a linear representation as opposed to a radial one, allows us to compare the sequence lengths more accurately from a perceptual standpoint.  Charles Darwin had the most varied day.
And finally, restore that chronological display aspect, and this allows us to spot the synchronicity, when are people sleeping or doing work or having meals?  At this point I would close the story by asking the viewer, how does your daily routine compare to these people here?  What story does your time line tell?  I want to finish by refit rating, the simplicity of what happened when, hopefully communicated this richness of a design space.  Different representations for time, different time scales you can use.  And this design space, grows even richer when we introduce dynamic storytelling elements like the incremental idea in the design space.  The projects wouldn't have been possible without the help of my colleagues at Microsoft Research and the University of British Columbia.  All the research that went into the choices in Timeline Storyteller, it's at timelines revisits.gitHub.io.  And timelinecurator.org.  And you can go and create your own timeline stories, accepts JSON, CSV data.  And as researchers at Microsoft, we're interested in what stories you build as well as collaborating with you to create stories together.  And if you're interested in joining a discuss about this type of data, about open challenges with timelines and standards for timelines data.  If you're a journalist, an educator, working with an educational institution or a publisher, invite you to join a timeline consortium, together with colleagues at Harvard X.  So, again, thank you very much for having me.  I look forward to seeing what stories you create and chatting over lunch.  Thanks.
