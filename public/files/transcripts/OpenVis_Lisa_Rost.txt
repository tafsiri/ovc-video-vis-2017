Unless just like it I thought like a fun title gets me into the conference.  It worked for me, but not for you.  I'm sorry.  But pretty pictures.  Like many of you I'm doing data visualization on an almost daily basis.  Mostly for news rooms.  And I have done it for a few years now.  And I really like it.  But from time to time I'm having an existential crisis.  Where I ask myself, does it actually make sense?  What am I doing here?  What's the impact I have on a reader or user?  Does it leave a dent?  Like do I make people care about the data?  Especially the data that can walk into the bar, meaning like human data points.
So today I want to talk about that.  How can we evoke feelings within visualization?  And I first want to talk about feelings and when they are good and bad and when we can and can't have them and why we should have them.  And then data visualization, and then talk about how to make feelings in data visualization.
So feelings.  We all have them.  These things that visit us from time to time.  These are a few.  I'm happy to be here, I'm grateful.  But a tiny version of that fear feeling, which is nervousness.  But there are two feelings that are a little bit separated.  They are empathy and compassion.  And they can be directed to someone else, and they can have as a content, every single other feeling.  Define the terms.  Empathy means that you're putting yourself in the shoes of somebody else.  Like you're feeling the feeling they feel.  You can be happy for somebody, you can be sad for somebody.  If you would have empathy with me right now, you would feel happy and nervous.  Compassion is different.  Compassion is love or sympathy for something.  If you would have compassion with me, you would be like, awww, and then sympathizing with me.
And almost everybody on this planet can agree that having empathy is better than not having empathy and compassion.  Smart people on the Internet said that empathy is the only way to survive war.  Good people make good societies.  And Obama said it you have empathy it makes it harder not to help.
And the empathy, we have had it the millions of years we're alive.  So this empathy for this kid at a shore in Turkey in 2015.  And this photo had huge consequences.  Donations spikes.  And European leaders have been shocked into forming more compassionate policies while previously hostile media outlets took a conciliatory turn.  It's like they were forced by emotions to act this way and change policies.
But empathy to one person, we're good at that.  But not to two people at the same time.  Imagine I put it here, and she would give a similar talk to me, but it would be hard to director your attention to any of us.  And imagine you were the only person still in the audience and everybody around you would be on the stage.  I'm not sure you would get anything out of that experience.
So that's why we can have empathy with this one kid, but it's really hard for us to have empathy with the 3,771 other people who also died crossing the Mediterranean Sea in 2015.  Meaning our lives are not all the same when it comes to our feelings.  That's how it should be.  One life should be worth like one something and then it gets up.  But that's how it actually is.  Like we have more empathy with one person or two people than we can feel with thousands of people.
That's why I concluded that emotions suck.  Because you can't multiply one man's suffering by a hundred million.  It's really� yeah.  It's really not helpful to have emotions.  Yeah.  They're not� okay, they're awesome, but they're not articulate.  It's not nuanced at all.  It's just like good and bad.  If you get candy from your mother, you're happy.  And two candies, you're not double happy.  If you swim in a sea of millions of candies, you're not one million times as with this one candy.  And it's the same with bad stuff.  Two deaths don't make you twice as miserable as one death.
And there was a lot of research into the topic.  He did a study that he showed people, okay, you can relate to this child.  She's miserable.  She comes from Syria.  And you can make her future secure and you can make her life better.  With that one child, I guess you would.  Again, you're really good at empathy.  But then the researchers showed a picture from another child.  You can still have the first child and donate the money to the first child.  But you can't help her neighbor who is also in Syria whose life is also miserable.  And showed more pictures.  You cannot donate to them, only to the first child.
And 40% drop in donations the researchers saw when showing the other pictures.  When showing the difference that you can't make� that's what researchers say is you want to feel good about happy.  You want to feel like you made a difference and don't want to get reminded of all the suffering we can't prevent in this world.
So it might actually be like that.  One plus one doesn't equal two.  One plus one is less than one.  We have empathy with one child, not with 3,000 children.  So much less than with the one child.  It's unfair.  It makes me superangry.  It's not articulate and it has a selfish like wants to have impact thing going on.  But, yeah, feelings kind of suck and I think we should not have them.
I mean, I think we should turn to humanity.  It's good.  Paul Bloom is a huge opponent of empathy.  If you want to do good and be good, empathy is a poor guide.  Yeah, rationality, one life is worth the same as a second and third and fourth life.  But empathy doesn't have that.  Empathy is super unfair.  We treat people better, we help them more and feel more empathy towards them if they look like us, they're closer to us, if they look like they need more help.  If they're cuter.  That's not fair at all.  This is rationality.  That's fair.
But then again, maybe we wouldn't care at all with rationality, because, you know, it's like holy� like why should I care?  Why should I care when I don't care?  Like this Syrian child, it doesn't have an impact on my economy.  I don't have an impact on that.
So maybe rationality is actually not the way to go.  Like only rationality.  I think you need both.  I think you need numbers.  You need emotional experience and abstract rationality, and a slow system too.  That's what I think should happen.  We should make people care about a topic and then explain how to do and what to do in rational terms.  Making decisions with your feelings is a bad idea.  But starting to care about a topic, here feelings can be really, really important.
So what does data visualization have to do with all that?  Well, most data visualization looks like that these days.  Here we have data about deaths, about traffic and about unemployment rates.  And I mean, these are visualizations that are all about people.  But it doesn't really do justice to the data to the people.  It's all rational.  It's all speaking through analytical mind.  And you might say that's good.  Don't want visualization to manipulate these photos and illustrations and all the other superemotional, bias, subjective media.  I would say, okay, that's fair.  Data visualization doesn't need to be objective.  That's not what I'm arguing for.  Like especially if you were in the science field.  You want your data visualization to be objective and not biasedlooking.
But I think data visualization is a tool.  We have talked a lot about tools.  I think data visualization itself is a tool that can be used differently like language or photography or painting.  So we should be able to do something like that, of course.  But we should also be able to do something like that.  Which is a bit more emotional, a bit more intense.  It's really like language.  You have this, but also poems that describe the various objective emotional words.
So data visualization is a tool you can do objectively.  But we should also have a toolkit for speaking more.  And that's what I want to talk about in the rest of the talk.  How to make feelings with data visualization if we want to do that.  And I have five points.  And I'm going to start with the two that focus on a style of a visualization.  So this is an image from this last talk.  It's a really good blog post.  You should read that if you haven't done that yet.  Yeah, the style of visualization.  I think there are two points I can think of.  Make use of colors.  Very simple, easy one.
This is a serial tracker that tracks the deaths of people.  And, again, it really doesn't do so much justice to the data we represent.  To the people it shows.  And I think with a little bit of color you can make it more intense.  Make it more appropriate, I would say.
In fact, the three most intense and emotional visualizations of the past few years make great use of color.   The first one is about gun deaths in the U.S.  The second one is about victims of the second World War.  And the third one is about deaths.  They have a black background and the colors that make it intense and impactful.
Second idea, show what you're talking about.  That's always an old trick.  This graphic designer already did it in the 1930s.  They did these at exhibitions and moved around and showed people� data about people.  And they showed them with symbols that represented the data so the people could imagine it better.
And it's still something used today, of course.  That's an example from the New York Times a few years back, and that's something from the Washington Post more recently.
So that's a still of a visualization.  But I think it gets more interesting if you're talking about how visualization can interact with the data points that it actually talks about.
So that's what I'm proposing here.  Show the what the data would mean if�your experience.  That would mean that you show what it means to be one of these data points in your visualization.  That's already done a lot.  Like every visualization where you enter your zip code, it shows you, for example, what the data looks like for your environment.  And what it looks like in the situation you're already in.  Like here, for example, this great graphic by Amanda that shows the unemployment rate.  You're employed, you're not employed, most often.  So it shows you the situation you're already in.
That's the same with this visualization about climate change that shows what happens in your life or in your future.  But I think it gets more interesting if it doesn't show you what you are already in, but brings you into another situation.  Almost like you will never be in.  For example, shows you what it to be a Syrian refugee.  That's definitely not a situation you will be in� I'm hoping.  So this is different.  This is a situation� a new situation for you.
I think it gets even more interesting if the situation� if you're not part of a situation, but situation is important to you.  Like in this advertisement.  A lot of you have seen, but I would love to show it again.  Hopefully it works.  Because I think it's really, really impactful.
>> Happy birthday to you.
>> Make a wish.
>> Granny.
>> Have you done your homework?
>> Ready or not.
>> Here it comes.
>> Clashes with�
>> Live ammunition.

>> Bye, mom.

>> Dad, where are we?  Daddy!
>> Happy birthday to you.  Make a wish, darling.
>> This video was seen by more than 55�million people on the Internet.  And, of course, you can do that with data visualization as well.  For example, this is a project in Germany.  The U.S. is pretty far away from Europe.  So when Trump thought about building that wall in the U.S., we in Europe didn't know what it means.  But basically, think if they planted a wall in front of your doorstep.  Let them drag a drop a wall for you and where it would be and how it would be.
And because, like the U.S. is pretty far away for you, but part of the U.S.� we like the map by Tim Wallace who planted Aleppo in Queens.  Planting the reality of someone else in front of your doorstep.
And you don't need to do visualization to get an effect.  We see something interesting here where they calculated the percentage of the Syrian population that got killed and transferred it to the American population.  I guess not many American people know what's going on in Syrian.  But 3 to 4�million Americans would be killed, I guess they would notice.
There are so many questions you can ask.  With which you can create these parallel universes and thought experiments.  And I would love to see it done more often with the data we have available.  To bring you into the situation and to bring the situation to you.
Fourth point, zooming into one dot.  Every project needs a story as the guys would say.  This is what they're doing.  They have beautiful maps at the top.  Very abstract.  But they have videos, if you scroll down.  That means they go into the street and ask people what's actually happening.  For example, that's a story about where people come from who currently live in Berlin.  So went on the street and asked where do you come from?  Why are you in Berlin?  Do you like it here?  That's a great idea, you can relate to a face better than you can relate to the shapes in a data visualization.  And the question of why.  Data visualizations are good at answering what's happening and how is it happening?  But not so often you know exactly why the people in the situation they are in right now.  So you can go on the street and ask, like, why are you here and you explore the possibilities of reasons.
And that's an old trick, of course.  Most feature stories start with the anecdote and then go highlevel and explain or show the numbers.  Where is this?  And who has a similar behavior or similar situation?  That's a page from NPR over here.
And, of course, like NGOs are not doing anything else.  Like this is something that I saw in a metro in D.C. a lot when I lived there last year.  It says we can't lose sight of the individuals.  Like you will never see an NGO that puts a post with a data visualization of how many people died.  You will always see the individual.  Because they want you to focus on that one story instead of the millions of people.
That's one of my favorite Twitter bots.  As someone who has worked with the American census quite a lot last year.  I really like it.  It takes one American life, one data point, and shows you some of the data it has about it.  And I think it's an amazing example for this idea that if you have facts and figures about millions of people, it's a statistic.  But if you have it about one person, it's a story.
And the fifth point.  Showing the mass as individuals.  So zooming into one dot meant we have the visualization, and then we have one example, like one data point that we show as an example.  But showing the mass as individual, means that the visualization is basically all of your data points.  Having something similar in mind when they talk about that although being totally abstinent for the rest of their lives is the goal of the program, alcohols are told to stay sober one day at a time or one hour at a time.  It makes it approachable and achievable.  The same can be done, again, with text.  Compare here, 800,000 killed in the last 800 days with one life lost every 11 seconds.�
The second one speaks to your mind.  And it's good for calculating numbers.  That's really important if you still have these huge numbers.  But the first one, the first sentence, speaks to your heart.  And, of course� of course I need to show that very famous project.  And I explain for the 5% who don't know it.  It is about U.S. gun deaths.  So this visualization, there are true arcs for every single life.  And at some point, these dots dropped because they got killed by a gun in the U.S.  But they continued drawing that arc to show how long that person would have lived.
And the visualization starts with one line.  With one arc.  It shows like an example.  It zooms into one dot and explains the visualization with that example.  But then it shows more and more.  And tells you how long they could have lived.  And it speeds up and you see two, three, four people killed.
and at some point, you get to this number.  It's 3588 stories in this one visualization, and you can look at every data point afterwards.  It's like what Abel Herzberg said, there were not 6�million Jews murdered, there was one murdered six million times.  Think about that when you digest numbers.  That situation that happened to so many people, what did it mean for the individual?  And you can identify some multiplier with this huge number.
This is not quite 6�million.  This is 5,000,00600,000.  This is the last number that was painted on a huge canvas.  He painted every single number from one to exactly this number.  You can see him doing that here.
And I sometimes wonder if he's actually maybe the person who can judge high numbers the best.  Because he spent time with every single one of these numbers, with every single one of these data points.  He drew one, two, three� et cetera.  And maybe he just took like ten to 30 seconds for one number, but it took him years.  Years to paint all these canvases and get through such a high number.  Talk about 5�million or 6�million people, it's Unbelievable.  And he knows at least that all the time he spent represents that number.  That's what your data was about too.
Like Stephanie, they did true visualizations about their life.  And they also spent time with every single data point by drawing it.  Here we're getting from like the user redesign to recreator.  Like what can you do to make your reader or user understand the data better versus what you can do to understand the data better as a creator?
And also talking about data humanists.  Instead of saving time with data, spend time with data.  And instead of data as numbers, data as people.  So that's what I would argue for this that you need to understand your data points really, really well to make better visualizations.  That you need to integrate the data points.
So that's what I was talking about.  Why feelings are good and why they are good.  I would argue that feelings are good for making us feel, but we should use rationality.  We need both.  Data visualization is tool that can, but doesn't need to evoke emotions.  And some examples what I think we can use to evoke emotions.  Which are these five tools.  I'm sure there are more.  And I'm happy to hear them.  Make use of colors and show what you're talking about.  Takes care of the style of the visualization.  Show what the data would mean for experience and zooming into one dot and showing the mass as individuals.  That's between the data points and the visualization.
So these are three important points, but there's a really important fourth point.  After making feelings with data visualization, we need to do something with these feelings.  We can't just leave people with feelings after we have created them.  We have some responsibility.
If you're angry, you need to punch something, sad, you need to cry.  And care about a child, you need to make a donation or feel like you can make an impact in this world and help.
And, of course, that question is left.  This is a topic I've cared about for a few months now, but I don't have all the answers.  For example, do these methods I presented evoke emotions?  I don't know.  There's not enough research done in this field to actually say that.  But I'm still curious to hear more methods.  I think if you built a toolkit of possible methods, that's going to be helpful.  And, of course, how do we inspire longterm?  As I said, if you don't just want to shock people and they make a onetime donation, in the best case we can inspire people to work on a problem longterm and can inspire them to change the world on a bigscale basis.
Thank you very much.
