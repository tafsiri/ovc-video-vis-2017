Visualizing Incarceration in the US on Polygraph
Matt Daniels

>> I want to go ahead and invite our next speaker.  We're a little bit early, to perhaps he's out of the room.  Oh, he's coming in.  Awesome.  I'll introduce Matt.  Matt Daniels, the founder of polygraph.  I'm sure you've seen interactive visual essays, and founder of the pudding.  Visual essays.  Since 2014, authored lots of articling with lots of traction in the national media, such as rappers ranked by the size of their vocabulary, film dialogue broken down by gender and how music taste has evolved over time.  Very excited he could join us to talk about a new piece he has been working on recently or is about to release specifically around incarceration data.  Something that we think a lot about in the U.S.  So please welcome Matt as he is slowly setting up his computer and I'm filling in space.

>> Okay.  So I'm going to talk to you about a project that has consumed me for the past sixth months.  It's basically a Moby Dick project which I have done several of.  I can't sleep until I solve it.  And it's one of the projects that's perfect for this industry, this domain of data visualization.  If we can solve it, we can essentially mic drop and stop.  It's so hard, and we have tread so much ground if we stop it.  It starts with Paul Lavande.  I saw him give a talk at a D3JS meetup in New York City.  He told the story about incarceration data starting with this slide.  So paraphrase him, but basically incarceration has gotten really bad in the U.S.  So on the lefthand side axis, prisoners per hundred thousand people in the U.S.  And in the '70s around 300 people.  In the past 40 or 50 years, gone up dramatically.  At such a point, if you're a man in the U.S., there's 100 per 100,000 people.  We're around 1%.  One,000 per 100,000 people.  That's a U.S. average.  Look at Louisiana, they're much higher.  And the funny thing about this is that it's a bipartisan issue.  All republicans and democrats.  They're not psyched when they look at this chart.
More or less everyone wants to decarcerate, which is great.  And the current rhetoric is pretty familiar.  A lot of you are like, yeah, this number is ridiculously high and obviously, it's the war on drugs.  Stop doing that.  Or systemic racism or mandatory minimums.  How many people know what mandatory minimums are?  That's a lot more than I thought.  So you commit a crime and there's a minimum sentencing guideline for the judge.  Or private prisons.  That is a hot topic in politics.  There is a financial incentive for the private prison industry to keep people in price.  Could be the case.  Could all be the case.  The funny thing when I ask people, how much do you think this contributes to the incarceration rate increase, everybody is like a lot.  But nobody knows for sure.  At least anecdote tally when I ask them.  This is perpetuated by a lot of stuff in media.  How many have seen this documentary, on the righthand side?  Thirteenth.  It's a tearjerker.  It's very intense.  Talks about racism in America from slavery to the present day criminal justice system and talks about the war on drugs.  And Jay Z did this great video on the war on drugs in the New York Times.  You see those, and we need to decriminalize marijuana and cocaine possession.  If we stop doing that, the incarceration rates will plummet.  And this is a really interesting story.
And I think when you're on the top of the layers of the onion, it kind of makes sense.  But when you pull back those layers, you start to see a lot more complexity.  So this is a chart looking at some of the statelevel data we have seen before.  Louisiana at the very top.  They're roughly around 0.8, 0.9 of the population is in prison.  Which is crazy.  One in 100 people, women and men are in prison in Louisiana.  And there are countless reasons for that.  And a lot of that is obscured from when we go back so the chart.  And the media and culture right now.  And states like New York, which have decarcerated over the last 20 years.  That second to bottom line.  And pull back the layer of the onion one more, it's actually New York City, and New York State has increased the number of prisoners over the past several years.  We're going as deep as we can and seeing how complicated incarceration is.  The other ridiculous thing, going back to these line charts, is that incarceration is a flow system.
So the way that we do it right now is every December�31st they count how many people are in prison.  All the states submit their data and we get an aggregate line right here.  But prison is a flow system.  So imagine that like traffic you have people in the fast lane, this lane right here.  Those are your one to twoyear time served individuals.  They're in and out of prison before the counts are even done sometimes.  And there's people in the slow lane.  And those are the people serving 20, 15year sentences.  And they're going to be there for a really long time.  But if we just stopped� I closed keynote.  If question looked at this frame right here, we're getting a myopic view of what's going on.
This is a flowchart that I didn't make.  But it's actually really helpful.  It's done by the Bureau of Justice Statistics several years ago.  What we measure is that circle on the upper right.  That's the prison system.  But these are the things that contribute to prison.  Lefthand side, crime.  So people commit a crime and it's reported to the police, hopefully.  And then the police decide to, like, investigate.  And then maybe it goes to an arrest.  And then it goes to the D.A.  Basically, your episode of �Law and Order.�  Then you hit charges filed.  And then they plead out, or not.  And there's all these if/then statements and then we end up in prison.  How we go from the righthand side to the righthand side is one of the things that I can't wrap my head around and it's been six months researching this.  Even the rates we move from arrest to charges filed, little tiny percentage changes in the dial request propagate to way more prisoners downstream.  So if you're thinking about, again, going back to the holy grail line chart, what will bring down the lines to the levels before has tons of different inputs going into it.  And reducing it to something as simple as the war on drugs would be a much more simplistic view of what's going on.
So my goal with this project, which was actually done for OpenVis Conf, was to visualize all the things.  If I were to spend a ton of time researching the facets of the funnel, what would it look like?  How could I understand it to look more like the traffic video than the line chart previously?  First I started collecting the data.
This was a Google Doc that I was working on with someone else of each of the stages of that funnel.  So we have crimes committed, crimes, felony filings and the data sources there for each of these stages of that funnel.  One thing that makes this whole entire project really difficult is that the prison system is not like an API that you can just call.  There are actually 50 different states doing entirely different things.  The way Louisiana runs their prison system is obviously different than New York State.
And they are either good data bookkeepers or they're terrible.  And putting all that data together, which is what the Bureau of Justice Department does� or Bureau of Justice Statistics does, is an immense undertaking and they do the best that they can with their budget.  But having uniform, clear, clean data is not a reality for visualizing the system.
The other really annoying thing is that the good data, I can't even open.  So you'll see this little red like highlighted background thing.  And this is the best data set I think that's out there, which is from the National Corrections Reporting program.  They give you a fence level data.   The number of people in prison for marijuana versus property crimes versus murder.  And to open this data set to the extent that I wanted to, you have to have a Ph.D. and be supported by an academic program.
So that's crazy.  And it's not like they're just being annoying, it's because there's a lot of personal data in that data set.  Like these are people that have felony convictions.  They already have a hard time.  Having them be the Guinea pig for a data study with their names thrown around.  I sort of empathize with why they're restricting the data access.  The data I was able to get was anonymized.  Too much.  This isn't the sentence link.  It's a number.  So number four is something like less than a year.  But number one is probably something like three to five years.  So we're not getting the level of fidelity that you would need to actually visualization this system.  You can't say the car is on the road from five to ten years.  Needs to be five years, one month.  So attempt one on this data showing what I just showed you I put out a couple months ago.
And the first thing I wanted to answer, at least visually, is in the data I could find, was how many people are in prison for certain crimes?  And the thing that I'm always shocked by is that the drug crimes are about 16% of the total prison population.  Which is a lot lower than what people think because we keep hearing it's higher.  And that's because a lot of the that's reported is shaped and nudged a certain way to seem higher than it is.  But on a national level, it's much lower.  What that meant for me, even if we release all of the people in prison for drug crimes, we would still have a hugely high incarceration rate.  I left out the statistic before, but the U.S. has 25% of the world's prison population, but 5% of the globe's human population.  The U.S. disproportionately has a high incarceration rate.  And even removing the drug criminals will not move it that much.  Half of them are violent criminals.  Talking about decarceration, and being softer on crimes.  We're talking about people who committed murder and robbery and rape and aggravated assault.  Those are things that are tough to talk about when you're talking about softer on crime, less punitive policies.
The next thing was how long it took for certain prisoners to leave prison.  The anecdotal, you have the low-level drug offender in jail for 20 years.  I'm sure there's someone in prison that got the short end of the stick and they're serving a much longer sentence than they deserve.  However, this is the 350,000 people that went into prison in the year 2000.  Here they are marching into prison.  And the years left in prison is what they are distributed into right now.  So about half of them will end up with a less than 12month prison term.  So after one year they're moved over into the free world bucket, and half of them are already out.
And then within the course of the next few years, by 2003, so three years later, about 75% of them are out.  And then over the course of five years, 86% are out.  And obviously, there are still people left in the ten-year bucket, which is highly unfortunate.  But most of the people in prison will be out within a very short time period.  Which starts to make you understand how much churn there is in this flow system.  The traffic is moving very fast.  People are getting on and off constantly.  With the crappy data that I had before, this is the best I could do to try to simulate this turnover rate.  So we start the year 2000 with what is that black line?  And then add in the admissions and remove the people released.  Move on to the next year.  These are all of the admissions.  Which is a staggering amount of the people that were already there.  Again, the turnover rate is really high.  And at the end of the year, we basically let out the same number.  So that's why the prison rate is roughly stable in the first slide.  Huge amount in, huge amount out, every single year.
So I was actually really underwhelmed by these results.  The thing that I wanted was the bird's eye view of the system.  What I have was basically an abstraction using a lot of assumptions the data had.  That was the case until I came across this data set.  I freaked out and cleared my calendar and just started working on this again.  So on our data set, Reddit datasets, there was this.  The current population of the Florida system, 100,000 inmates.  I couldn't believe it until I went to the site, right here.  And there it is.  We have a 1.2 gigabyte Microsoft access database file to download.  It dawned on me how to do this.  If you have heard of Florida man on Twitter, or read news about the crazy things coming out of Florida.  It's not because crazy people live in Florida, but the journalisms have unprecedented access to what happens in the police and court system in Florida due to their stance on transparency.  They will grant more FOIA requests than other states.  They're doing it for prisons.  So the detail on this is just amazing.  You can look up any offender.  Not to pick on anybody, but this is the level of detail.  Photos, names.  This person is actually deceased in prison.  What they went to prison for after they passed away� so they were there for a felony gun charge.  But then they had previous prison history of burglary.  So they were in prison May�1st, 1990.  Left prison December�31st, 1990.  And back again a year and a half later.  This is the bird's eye view that I wanted, right?  A little bit more detail about the data in the Microsoft database access form.  Hundreds of thousands of resolutions data of data about why they were in prison as well.  So this is the adjudication charge.  This person failed to appear, felony bail.  Sexual batter, unspecified.  Crazy amounts of detail.  The funny thing is they cluster this into drug offense.  It's actual, raw text that I'll have to Parse eventual.  And their names.  So we saw this before in the profile they brought up.  The individual's names.  Actually have their addresses as well.  Which is mind blowing.  I'm scared to mention it for fear that they pull it down.  As well as tattoos.  Look at row two, Yosemite Sam.  And the prompt that I had to myself, if this were to be the wardens of the Florida prison system, what would we make?  We wouldn't make a simple bar chart.  I would want something that really gave me an aerial view of what's going on.
And the thing that I kept coming back to are these blocks by Elijah Meeks who maybe is here, I haven't seen him.  And it's� these� this is representative, but particles moving through different nodes.  And Nico year from Uber talked about illustrative particles that were randomly generated.  I want need to be people.  I want to know how long it is from here to here.  Here's another example I was inspired by.  You can imagine this was the BJS flowchart from before.  Arrest on the lefthand side, release on the righthand side or parole.  The thing this is missing is the recidivism rate.  The reoffense rate.  People who leave prison and then come back.
So attempt two.  This is a project that I have been coding for the past few weeks up until the moment of this morning.  So they say never to do a live demo.  But screw it.  We're going to do a live demo.  And let's make this a little bit bigger.  Okay.
So this is the Florida prison population on January, 2010.  And the way that this is framed is kind of that linear timeline that we saw before of sentencing on the lefthand side, people locked up in prison and then released on the righthand side.  Each of these boxes represent 50 people.  But it's to an abstraction of 50 people, it's actually 50 people.  So if we were to click one of these nodes.  These are the individuals in that little cluster up there, which I'll get to in a second in terms of what it means.  And we can click on their profile and see all the detail.  Obviously, I could also add that into the visualization, which I'll hopefully get to.  But this is the level� we're not working with abstractions.  It's not illustrative.  It's trying to visualize the system in detail.  And there's people in this section here that are here for life.  And it's a little bit weird to see this level of humanity in a data visualization.  I think actually really important when we're talking about statistics in prisons.  These are all old men.  Predominantly old black men.  And thinking about a punitive criminal justice system, saying we're going to lock them in and throw away the key.  You can empathize it's probably unlikely they will recommit.  Why are they still in prison for life?  One of the other cool things is advancing the timeline.
So it's not on autoplay quite yet.  But to advance it one month to February 2010, we have the little red squares moving from the lefthand side to the righthand side and adding on to the visualization.  So if you were the warden just watching the whole system from your bird's eye view, all the red squares would be new faces from January to February.
So continuing this process of the flow, moving left to right� sorry, moving from January to April.  So four months have passed by.  Again, all the red squares are new faces.  And this is getting to the turnover rate of prisons.  So if we advance this to July, only seven months later, this entire section up top is almost entirely red.  Again, completely new faces entering into prison.  That top section is actually� for the people that can't see it� people serving less than 12 months.  Middle, one to three years, three to five years.  So if you're entering your ten-year sentence, for example, you're slotting right into this square.  Which are about 4% of people admitted every month.
The other thing is just jumping around in this timeline with the data that we have.  So moving to, for example, let's see� present day.  December�2012.  Or December 2016.  It looks pretty much the same.  Which is the case.
Because we have 97,000 people in Florida prison right now, and when I started this visualization we had 103,000.  So, again, really, really high turnover rate.  But roughly where we were before.  Going back to the crappy example I had using the anonymized data.  The other thing that's really fun with this is watching the release column build.
So that's this far right column right here.  And because they only have a one month left on their prison term, if you advance it, they move over here and I have a box just tracking how many people have been released from prison over that time period.  So if we move forward, again, like six months, we have 17,000 people released from prison, which, again, is insane considering there are only 103 people in prison.  Again, really, really high turnover rate which I think is kind of mind boggling when you can see the entire system set up.
All right.  So that's my live demo.  The user for this is not the academics.  I can show this.  And they're like, yeah, water is wet.  I know all of those things.  They know drugs don't drive most of the prison system.  They know that terms are really low.  But they actually are pretty inconsequential in the policy.  The people who drive prison policy are our grandparents and our parents and our siblings.  The voters.  So the biggest fulcrums in the system are actually prosecutors.  And the policy that we want our police officers to handle.  Are they arresting you for marijuana possession?  Or are they showing a blind eye?
And if I can get my grandmother to understand some of these things, not that it's down to mandatory minimums and tree strike laws and the war on drugs, things that don't decarcerate the system, that's a huge win and the data visualization in my mind.
I left off one point which is what I wanted to mention.  This is still visualizing the prison system.  And I want to emphasize that the people getting released, they matter a lot too.  So these are felons that will have a record the rest of their life, potentially.  It's hard to get jobs.  It's hard to find housing.  It is the scarlet letter that we place on our society.  So thinking about that like 20,000 people released in six months, and the percentage of the people that are just in prison already is really, really crazy.
There's still a lot of work I want to do on this beyond my train ride up here.  Running simulations.  What would happen if you cut the admissions in half next month?  And did that for all the following months?  How long for the prison population to go down?  Obviously would happen quickly.  If you go back to the slides I was showing early, if 30% of people leave prison, we would be down to the 1970s rate in a few years.  Thinking about admissions as the driver is incredibly impressive for understanding the power and control that we have over Decarserating America.  And I haven't added in offenses.  Repeat offenders.  So I have started looking at this already.  Haven't added to the Viz.  Twenty% of the people had been in Florida prison previously.  Showing the movement back into the system is really important.  And also for understanding that scarlet letter that we place on former felons.  Or people who committed a felony and have them released from prison.  They are committing crime again or violating their parole and ending up back in the system.
And then upstream data.  So I met a team working on this from the ACLU.  They're thinking about arrests in Massachusetts and tying all of those things together and thinking about the tiny percentage rate changes that could propagate into the prison system is immensely important.
That's it.  You can follow along on the pudding.  And thank you.
